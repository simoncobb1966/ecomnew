Bond and Amasova follow a suspicious tanker owned by Stromberg and establish it is responsible for the missing submarines; the submarine in which they are travelling is also captured by Stromberg. Stromberg plans to destroy Moscow and New York, triggering nuclear war; he planned to then establish a new civilisation. Bond escapes, freeing the submariners captured from the other submarines and follows Stromberg to his headquarters, where he shoots the tycoon and a torpedo destroys the base.\"\n    }\n    ],\n    qtyOfTasks: 0\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n    alert (this.state.customer[0].name)\n    return (\n\n      <div className=\"outerdiv\">\n\n        <div class=\"container\">\n          {/* <div className=\"row banner\">\n            <Header />\n          </div> */}\n\n\n          <div className=\"maindiv\">\n\n          <div className=\"row banner\">\n            <Header />\n          </div>\n\n            <div className=\"row\">\n\n              <div className=\"col-sm\">\n              </div>\n\n              <div className=\"col-sm\">\n              </div>\n\n            </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"container maindiv\">\n              <row>\n                <Buttonsrow \n                loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn}\n                login={this.state.login}\n                displayIfLoggedIn={this.state.displayIfLoggedIn}\n                displayIfLoggedOut={this.state.displayIfLoggedOut}\n                buttonHandlerFunction={this.buttonHandler}\n                \n                customer={this.state.customer}\n                />\n              </row>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"maindiv\">\n            <div class=\"container\">\n              <div className=\"row innerarea\">\n                {\n                  this.state.jb.map((item, i) => {\n                    return <Productsmall\n                      indexkey={i}\n                      jb={this.state.jb[i]}\n                      \n                      buttonHandlerFunction={this.buttonHandler}\n                    />\n                  })\n                }\n\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-sm-12\">\n              <Footer />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div >\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
