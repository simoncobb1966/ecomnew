Stromberg plans to destroy Moscow and New York, triggering nuclear war; he planned to then establish a new civilisation. Bond escapes, freeing the submariners captured from the other submarines and follows Stromberg to his headquarters, where he shoots the tycoon and a torpedo destroys the base.\"\n    }\n    ],\n    qtyOfTasks: 0\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n    // alert (this.state.customer[0].name)\n    return (\n\n      <div className=\"outerdiv\">\n\n        <div class=\"container\">\n          <div className=\"maindiv\">\n            <div className=\"row banner darkyellow\">\n              <Header />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div className=\"col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12 centered\">\n\n          <row>\n            <div className=\"buttonsRow\">\n              <Buttonsrow\n                loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn}\n                login={this.state.login}\n                displayIfLoggedIn={this.state.displayIfLoggedIn}\n                displayIfLoggedOut={this.state.displayIfLoggedOut}\n                buttonHandlerFunction={this.buttonHandler}\n                customer={this.state.customer}\n              />\n            </div>\n          </row>\n\n\n\n          <div className=\"maindiv\">\n            <div class=\"container\">\n              <div className=\"row innerarea\">\n                {\n                  this.state.jb.map((item, i) => {\n                    return <Productsmall\n                      indexkey={i}\n                      jb={this.state.jb[i]}\n\n                      buttonHandlerFunction={this.buttonHandler}\n                    />\n                  })\n                }\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-sm-12\">\n              <Footer />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div className=\"registerPageVisible\">\n          <Register />\n        </div>\n\n\n\n      </div >\n\n\n\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
